                        You’ve worked hard in your career for years. With every
                        paycheck you have received, it is likely that your
                        employer has deducted partial premiums for private long
                        term disability (“LTD”) insurance. These insurance
                        policies are issued and administered by huge private
                        insurance companies. These policies are supposed to
                        provide you with monetary benefits (usually 60%-80% of
                        your normal earnings, depending on the policy), in the
                        event you become disabled due to injury or illness.<br /><br />

                        Like most people, you probably don’t think twice about
                        what that payroll deduction is going towards, until the
                        unthinkable happens, and you find yourself disabled and
                        unable to work. Most expect that their LTD insurance
                        policy will be there as a safety net, insuring that you
                        and your family will be able pay the bills in your time
                        of need. Unfortunately, most claimants who find
                        themselves disabled and out of work, will face denials
                        of benefits from the companies that administer these LTD
                        policies. The law that governs these policies is known
                        as “ERISA,” which is an acronym for The Employee
                        Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. §1132.
                        This federal legislation has caused more stress for
                        disabled workers, and allowed insurance companies that
                        issue LTD policies to act with impunity in denying valid
                        claims, than any piece of legislation in American
                        history. However, the more you know about ERISA and how
                        these claims are handled by our federal courts, the
                        better your chances are of “leveling the playing field”
                        and getting the benefits you deserve.<br /><br />

                        If your claim is denied, it has been reviewed by a “plan
                        administrator,“ an employee of the insurance company who
                        is given virtually endless discretion in determining
                        whether to deny your LTD claim. Before you can pursue
                        the denial of your claim in federal court, you must
                        first “exhaust your administrative remedies.” This means
                        you must completely submit your claim to the internal
                        appeals procedure put in place by the insurance company.
                        There are often many levels of appeals, usually with the
                        same result: claim denied. Once you have exhausted your
                        administrative remedies, you finally have a right to
                        file a lawsuit.

                        Once your case is in federal court, things get even
                        stranger. The LTD case is not tried in the traditional
                        sense. There are no testifying witnesses, no cross
                        examinations, and no closing arguments by lawyers. To
                        the contrary, most LTD cases are simply decided by a
                        federal judge who examines the “administrative record,”
                        which is your claim file, as compiled by the insurance
                        company. Think of it as a “basket” in which all the
                        relevant documentation to your claim is dropped,
                        including: questionnaires completed by you, your medical
                        records, and statements of treating physicians as well
                        as those of the “hired gun” physicians employed by the
                        insurance company. The administrative record is the only
                        evidence reviewed by the federal judge in a LTD case.<br /><br />

                        Under the law, after reviewing the administrative
                        record, the court can only reverse a LTD denial, if it
                        finds the insurance company’s determination was
                        “arbitrary and capricious.” This means there was no
                        evidence, at all, to support the insurance company’s
                        denial.

                        Sounds like a pretty unfair process doesn’t it? The
                        passage of ERISA certainly was a coup for the insurance
                        industry. It allowed them to deny thousands of claims,
                        and effectively keep disabled claimants from obtaining
                        the justice they deserve. Nonetheless, LTD cases brought
                        under ERISA can still be won if you take certain steps
                        to level the playing field.

                        The file is closed. Remember how I previously said to
                        think of the administrative record as a “basket” in
                        which certain documentation is placed relevant to your
                        claim? Therefore, it is extremely important to fill that
                        “basket” with as much favorable evidence as possible,
                        which supports your claim that you are indeed suffering
                        from a long term disability. So, how do we do that?
                        <br /><br />

                        First and foremost, it is absolutely crucial that you
                        get an ERISA attorney involved in your claim as soon as
                        you are denied by the insurance carrier, who can start
                        taking steps to make the administrative record more
                        favorable to you. We can do that numerous ways,
                        including supplementing the file with client
                        testimonials about their daily activities and abilities.
                        (This is about as close as a LTD claimant will come to
                        “testifying” in ERISA cases). I often also use the
                        assistance of Vocational Experts, persons qualified to
                        testify in court as to a claimant’s loss of access to
                        jobs in the national economy. Vocational Experts will
                        often author detailed reports regarding our client’s
                        disabilities which a judge will read and consider when
                        making the final judicial determination in a LTD case.
                        Furthermore, some cases warrant the use of independent
                        physicians who will examine our clients and provide a
                        disability assessment report and offer opinions as to
                        whether an individual has the functional ability to be
                        employed.

                        medical records and review them for accuracy. I have had
                        more than one case where the insurance carrier told my
                        client that their treating physician said “X”, when in
                        reality, the doctor said “Y”. Reviewing your own records
                        helps keeps the insurance company honest. Next, keep a
                        very accurate list of the names and addresses of all
                        health care providers you have seen for your illness and
                        injury. This makes gathering medical records much easier
                        for your attorney. In addition, make sure that you
                        carefully read those lengthy letters that you receive
                        from the insurance carrier during the claims process.
                        These often contain deadlines pertaining to appeals
                        periods, and when the administrative record will close.
                        Further, if you send anything to the insurance company,
                        send it certified mail, and make a copy of all
                        documentation sent. Next, be VERY careful what you say
                        to the adjuster handling your LTD claim. They will turn
                        the most innocuous statement into a claim-denying event.
                        Also, if the insurance company sends you questionnaires,
                        fill them out as completely as possible. If the
                        insurance form doesn’t provide you with enough room to
                        relate the circumstances of your condition, attach
                        additional pages. Finally, be aware that insurance
                        carriers often hire investigators to spy on you, usually
                        shortly prior to physician exams, or independent medical
                        evaluations that are set up by the insurance carrier.
